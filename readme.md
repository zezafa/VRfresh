# VRfresh (2016)
> We outfitted a fitness bike with Arduino and several sensors enabling the user to play video games while working out.

_Prerequisites_:
* Arduino Leo
* FreePie + vJoy in order to emulate game input  
* Hall Sensor (in order to track RPM of the crank)
* Capacitive Sensors for brake levers
* Compass Sensor or Android Smartphone to track the direction of handlebars

Our project got featured in a major Danish newspaper:

The code is not documented, but feel free to contact me if you would like to setup something similar yourself. I would be more than happy to share our experiences and help you out with the code.
